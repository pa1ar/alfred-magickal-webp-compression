Welcome to the Alfred Smart WebP repository: **An Alfred Workflow** ✨

### Original Author

This project was originally created by [Benjamin Oddou](https://github.com/BenjaminOddou). Full credit for the initial development goes to him. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/BenjaminOddou/alfred-smart-webp-compression).

### Contributions by me

I have merely upadted the original workflow to include color profiles.

## Prerequisites

* MacOS
* Alfred 5. Note that the [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is required to use workflows.
* [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) (for handling color profiles).
* A valid color profile file (.icc/.icm), if color profile embedding is desired.

## Installation

Please refer to the original repository for installation instructions. The only difference is that you need to have ImageMagick installed on your system and get .icc/.icm from somewhere (Adobe website or smth).

`brew install imagemagick`
